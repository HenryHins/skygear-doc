## To be discussed

- Plugin vs Core
  - CoreDB vs Plugin DB
    - Plugin have it own store

## Consensus


Client side code is better than server code
Being pramatic is better than being beautiful
Reliable better than performance
Stateless is better than stateful
There should be one best way to do things
If SDK interface is difficult to understand, it's a bad idea



- Client side code over server side code
  - We expect the develop to write more client side code rather than server
    side code.
- Pragmatic
  - Donâ€™t aim for a beautiful solution, accept that there are use cases that
    aren't covered by our implementation. 
  - Pick the popular solution instead of a performant solution.
- Intuitive development interface
  - Don't reinvent syntax?
  - Example: SDK design works just like other SDKs of the same development
    environment.
- Reliability over performance
- Stateless plugin design is recommended
  - Stateless design is better in terms of scalability

Need more discussion to develop this idea:

- Don't reinvent the wheel.
  - Example: NSPredicate
